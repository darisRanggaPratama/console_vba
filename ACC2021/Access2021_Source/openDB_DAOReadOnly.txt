' The following procedure opens a database for shared, read-only access. When the second 'argument of the OpenDatabase method is set to ' False, the database is opened in shared mode. 'This is the default setting. If the value of this argument is True, the database is opened ' in 'exclusive mode (other users are prevented from opening the database). The third argument of the 'OpenDatabase method specifies whether ' you want to open the database with read/write (default) 'or read-only access. To open the database in read-only mode, set the value of  'this argument 'to True as demonstrated in the following procedure.

Sub openDB_DAOReadOnly()
  Dim db As DAO.Database
  Dim t As Variant
  Dim strNames As String

  strNames = ""

  ' Open for shared read-only access

  Set db = DBEngine.OpenDatabase(CurrentProject.Path & _
   "\Northwind 2007.accdb", False, True)

  For Each t In db.TableDefs
    strNames = strNames & t.Name & vbCrLf
  Next
  MsgBox "The following tables were found:" & _
   vbCrLf & strNames
  db.Close
End Sub

' You can try out this procedure by entering it in the Code window of the current VBA module and 'then running it. When the procedure finishes executing you should see a message box with the 'list of all the tables found in the Northwind 2007 database.

'In the preceding DSN-less connection, we pass to the Open method of the Connection object a connection string that specifies how a driver 
'connects to a data source. Here, Driver specifies that you want to use the dBASE database file. Notice that the value of the driver is 
'entered between curly brackets {}. DBQ informs the ADO Connection object about the physical path to the file. The remaining code of this 
'procedure is identical to the code used in the DSN connection in Hands-On 10.2.

Hands-On 12.10. Connecting to an SQL Server Database Using SQLOLEDB Provider

Note:  To try out this procedure, modify the connection information in the connection string to connect to the SQL Server database you have access to.


1.In the Visual Basic Editor window, choose Insert | Module.
2.In the module’s Code window, type the following ConnectToSQL_SQLOLEDB procedure: 

Sub ConnectToSQL_SQLOLEDB()
  Dim conn As ADODB.Connection
  
  Set conn = New ADODB.Connection
  ' Modify the connection information

  With conn
    .Provider = "SQLOLEDB"
    .ConnectionString = "Data Source=Mozartv4;" & _
     "database=Musicians; UserId=sa; Password=;"
    .Open
  End With

  If conn.State = adStateOpen Then
    MsgBox "Connection was established."
  End If

  conn.Close
  Set conn = Nothing
End Sub

3.	Choose Run | Run Sub/UserForm to execute the procedure.
In the ConnectToSQL_SQLOLEDB procedure, the Connection object’s Provider property is set to SQLOLEDB, and the ConnectionString property includes a server name, database name, user ID, and password information.
The following VBA procedure uses the ODBC DSN-less connection to an SQL Server database:

Sub Connect_ToSQLServer()
  Dim conn As ADODB.Connection

  Set conn = New ADODB.Connection
  With conn
    ' DSN-less connection using the ODBC driver
    ' (modify the data source information below)
    .Open "Driver={SQL Server};" & _
     "Server=11.22.17.153;" & _
     "UID=myId;" & _
     "PWD=myPassword;" & _
     "Database=SupportDb"
    .Close
  End With
  Set conn = Nothing
End Sub
